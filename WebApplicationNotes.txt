What is a POST request?
- A POST request is an HTTP method to pass parameters to a web application

What is JSON?
- file format that makes data easier to read for human eyes.

Base64?
- Encoding scheme
- easily reconigizble by equal signs at the end of the string

SQL:
- Structured Query Language is used to communicate with a database
- SQL Injections are when a web application sends a query to some SQL database but does not sanitize their inputs, allowing a user to insert snippets of SQL which will execute from said SQL database
- Union Based SQL Injection - This technique allows for us to extract information from the database via the union operator
- Blind SQL Injection is when the web application has been configured to show generic error messages relating to the invalid query, but has not actually fixed the vulnerability.
