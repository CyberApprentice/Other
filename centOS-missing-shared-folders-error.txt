CentOS/redhat error - VMware shared folders not found

This is probably because VMware didn't properly install VMware tools so we basically remove it and reinstall it.

(as root)

yum delete open-vm-tools

yum install perl

(1) Guest > Install VMware Tools
(2) mkdir /mnt/cdrom
(3) mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
(4) cp /mnt/cdrom/VMwareTools-version.tar.gz /tmp/
(5) cd /tmp
(6) tar -zxvf VMwareTools-version.tar.gz
(7) cd vmware-tools-distrib
(8) ./vmware-install.pl
(9) reboot
