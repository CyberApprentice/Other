-------------- 2 -------------------------

problem: 500 internal server error on web page after startup

solution: For me, this occured when I set a staic IP address for the webGUI via "SPLUNK_BINDIP=10.10.10.1" in the splunk-launch.conf. What you must do is go in the web.conf (splunk\etc\system\default\web.conf for Windows) and set the same address to the variable "mgmtHostPort = 127.0.0.1" on line ~32.
